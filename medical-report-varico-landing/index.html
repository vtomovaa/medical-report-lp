            <p>There is a widespread belief that varicose veins cannot be removed in a short period of time and without
                surgery. Although this fact has been outdated since the 2000s, most people still believe today that one
                needs to undergo surgery to get rid of swelling and varicose veins.

            <p>However, healthcare is not standing still. This is particularly true in the area of ​​phlebology ( the
                science of the structure and functioning of veins) . One of the globally successful inventions of recent
                years is a cream against varicose veins called <b><a href="../../../c/index.php?lang=de">Varico

                    <p>I have large varicose veins on my legs. They hurt all the time. But this cream relieves me of my
                        pain immediately. Even the swelling has reduced. Now I recommend them to all my friends.

                    <p>I have tried many things to combat my varicose veins, including homeopathic products.
                        Unfortunately, I only achieved minimal results with this. Sometimes my varicose veins reduced a
                        little, but they always came back. With the <b><a href="../../../c/index.php?lang=de">Varico
                                Revita</a></b> everything goes away really quickly.

                    <p>In my case it worked... When I was 31, I went to the doctor to get my varicose veins treated. I
                        was recommended surgery. However, I didn't want one because of my diabetes.
